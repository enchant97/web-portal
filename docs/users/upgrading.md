# Upgrading & Migrating
Before upgrading please check the changelog to ensure there are no warning about changes. This project also uses semantic version numbers, read about it [here](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). But basically if you are on 1.0.0 and latest is 2.0.0 you should remove all app data before installing as there **will be** incompatibilities.

## Migrating From V1
This assumes you are running minimum V1.4.0. This will also only import links, you will still have to setup groups/assignments again.

1. Go to V1 app navigate to Settings > Export > Download V1
2. In V2 app navigate to Settings > Admin > Import V1
