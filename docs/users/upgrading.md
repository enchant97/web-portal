# Upgrading & Migrating
Before upgrading please check the changelog to ensure there are no warning about changes. This project also uses semantic version numbers, read about it [here](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). But basically if you are on 1.0.0 and latest is 2.0.0 you should remove all app data before installing as there **will be** incompatibilities.
