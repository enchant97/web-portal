Welcome to the Web-Portal docs. The documentation is split into two sections one for users and the other for developers.

## What Is Web Portal?
Web Portal is a all-in-one web dashboard, providing many widgets to build a personal portal. With the ability to load external plugins.

> If you want just a basic link panel configured with a yaml file checkout Web Portal Lite available here: <https://github.com/enchant97/web-portal-lite>.
